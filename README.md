# ![4Geeks Logo](http://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16) TODO List with React and Fetch

✏ *Creating a TODO list application that allows users to add tasks and mark / unmark them as complete with **React** and synchronizing them with a real database, using a **RESTful** and public API made for this exercise. Inspired in **./preview.gif***.

## Instructions 📄

* The tasks are added when the user enters any text and press the ***Enter*** key or press the ***Add*** button.
* The *task completion icon* shows on the left of each task.
* The user can add as many tasks as needed.
* When there is no tasks the list will say *...No tasks... for now*.

## Preview 🎬
* You can open this repository in **Gitpod**.
* Start the webpack server with live reload running the next command: `$ npm run start`
* If you can't start the server, run the following command: `$ npm install`
