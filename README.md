✏ *Creating a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks with **React** by sync our todo list with a real database, using a **RESTful** and public API made for this exercise. Inspired in **./preview.gif***.

## Instructions 📄

* The tasks are added when the user enters any text and press the ***Enter*** key or press the ***Add*** button.
* The *delete icon* shows on the right of each task. 
* The *task completion icon* shows on the left of each task.
* The user can add as many tasks as needed.
* When there is no tasks the list will say *...No tasks... for now*.
* Total tasks numbers will be displayed by priorities.
* The tasks can only be deleted or marked / unmarked as completed.
* The ***Remove all*** button will be remove all created task. 

## Preview 🎬
* You can open this repository in **Gitpod**.
* Start the webpack server with live reload running the next command: `$ npm run start`
* If you can't start the server, run the following command: `$ npm install`
