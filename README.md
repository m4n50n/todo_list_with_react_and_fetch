![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4n50n/todo_list_with_react_and_fetch/main/screenshot_preview.png)

✏ *Creating a TODO list application that allows users to add tasks and mark / unmark them as complete with **React** and synchronizing them with a real database, using a **RESTful** and public API made for this exercise. Inspired in **./preview.gif***.

## Instructions 📄

* The tasks are added when the user enters any text and press the ***Enter*** key or press the ***Add*** button.
* The *task completion icon* shows on the left of each task.
* The user can add as many tasks as needed.
* When there is no tasks the list will say *...No tasks... for now*.

## Preview 🎬
* You can open this repository in **Gitpod**.
* Start the webpack server with live reload running the next command: `$ npm run start`
* If you can't start the server, run the following command: `$ npm install`
* If you receive a react-bootstrap error, install it running the following command: `$ npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3`
